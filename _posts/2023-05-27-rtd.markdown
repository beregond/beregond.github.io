# Todo lists for dilligent scribes

Today most of todo lists are already in phone, but if paper todo lists are still thing for you - you might like this.
Below you can find system I am working with, as I needed something that covers my needs, is simple to use, easy to recognize but is also visually appealing.

Of course if you need more statuses, you can extend this, to fit your needs:

(Even more possiblities open if you go out of the box, but boy, I didn't have enough courage.)

## Template

If you want to print template, you can use diamond character - **◇** - (actually this is rhombus ¯\_(ツ)_/¯) and print this on paper, creating template for daily use.

## Stencil

If you are truly neo-vintage you can also 3d print a stencil for your todo lists - <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6047922>
