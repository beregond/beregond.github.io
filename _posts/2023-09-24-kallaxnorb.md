If you have a lot of screws, nuts and other small parts you quickly come to conclusion you need sorters. A lot of them. And also a cabinet for them as well. You can try something like [Adam Savage's Sortimo Storage Cabinet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNHDs3qlYIg), or you can make something more on budget using Kallax from Ikea and NORB16 sorters.

First lest talk about NORB16 sorter. It has the same nice feature as Sortimo - you can take out whole bin with parts.

Although it is smaller - it is also cheaper and fits pretty nice to Kallax from Ikea.

## Parts

First - parts to 3D print - you can download them from [Thingiverse page](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6233392):
  - print **one** template
  - print **8 left brackets and 8 right brackets per cube** to make 4 shelves (+one from kallax itself) - this will give you space for 5 sorters


Second - shelves. I bought ready 30x30cm plywood panels, 8mm thick and painted them.

Third - wood screws - I used 3.5x35mm but anything near (like 3x25mm) should also be fine.

## Assembly

Steps to do:

  - Put screws into bracket holes.

  - Align bracket with template; you can do it yourself with one hand, but if you have someone to help - it will be easier (especially when screwing side with your non-dominant hand) and mount brackets with power screwdriver.

  - Once you done you can put panel inside.

  - Repeat until you have 4 levels, notches on top of brackets will align with hinges of next level bracket.

  - Then you can cut notches and sacrificial hinges - you can use knife, but if you just lever them and bend - they will break.

  - Note - if you want you can cut out top notches **before** mount - they are not crucial in alignment and without them you don't need knife after you mount brackets. You can also leave sacrificial parts - they won't interfere with anything.

  - Done, you can print parts in your Kallax color and paint panels the same for aestetic.
