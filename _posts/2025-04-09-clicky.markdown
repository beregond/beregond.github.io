I needed something that clicks to indicate rotational movement BUT in both ways with the same sound. Turns out it is not that simple, but if you combine two ratchets - you get exactly what you need. The problem is to make it sound EXACTLY the same in both directions - to achieve that I combined them vertically - and for demonstration purposes I made a small fidget toy.

For details you can check [Thingiverse page](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6381675) - there are two versions - including one with handles. As for the note - it makes pretty satisfying fidget toy, but be careful - you can drive your family to the point of meltdown. Also I named it as "fishbone" because it reminds me of it, I bet someone somewhere already named it somehow, but couldn't find reference.

And as honorable mention - prototype graveyard.
