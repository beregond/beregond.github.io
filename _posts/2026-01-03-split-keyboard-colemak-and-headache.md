If you’ve ever wanted to switch to a split keyboard and/or the Colemak (DH) layout, and you’re wondering how this works with Vim, here are some notes after 2 years of usage.

## Split keyboard

Let’s talk about the split keyboard alone first – simply put, for me, a split keyboard is a great feature just because you can fit your notebook between the keyboard halves – and for that alone, I would choose it over a traditional one. Another perk is that your wrists are in a more natural position – especially if you buy an ergonomic keyboard, like the Moonlander shown in the picture above.

As for drawbacks – such a keyboard can be pretty expensive.

## Colemak DH

Ref: [My current layout](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/wGYEn/latest/0)

In short – yes, it is faster and more ergonomic, BUT:

* You don’t want to use it on a standard keyboard. You can, obviously, but it’s pretty annoying, as Colemak’s requirements are a bit beyond what a regular keyboard can handle. To make it useful, you should go for a custom, preferably programmable, keyboard.

* The learning curve is steep. It took me 6 months of daily programming work to feel pretty confident. Of course, you will only struggle for the first few weeks, but to REALLY feel the benefits – it takes longer.

* You still need to remember QWERTY – because in places other than your office, you will only encounter QWERTY. This is actually a good reason NOT TO learn Colemak – you won’t be able to completely ditch QWERTY. That means you need to become a "bi-layout typist."

* ...and also, if you use the same keyboard for a few machines, you’ll want to have a QWERTY fallback mode for playing games, as most of them are designed for that standard layout.

## Vim

Typing in Vim and on a split keyboard – no difference, if not better.

Typing in Vim and with Colemak – well... The problem with that duo is the movement keys: g, h, j, k. Forget about intuitive movement; you need to adapt and use other movements, or switch to using the arrow keys, or accept that those keys are now in a completely different place.

Other than that, Colemak and Vim are pretty good mates. I must admit that in the early stages, I decided not to edit any Vim bindings and adapt my keystrokes to the new layout (which means you need to go with your memorized Vim shortcuts by key names, against muscle memory at first), but in general, after some time, it went pretty well for me.

I do acknowledge, though, that if you use Vim mainly by muscle memory, you may have a hard time at the beginning.

## Headache

A bit annoying in the whole process is that once you become fluent in Colemak DH, it gets harder to use QWERTY on a daily basis. So, you want to have the same split keyboard everywhere you work (didn’t I mention it’s pretty pricey already?) or bring your keyboard with you everywhere, which becomes really annoying if you want to commute every day or go on a business trip by plane.

Especially when you're on a business trip and leave your keyboard at home, you have to switch back to QWERTY mode (remember, you don’t want to use Colemak on a standard keyboard?). This makes you look like a total beginner when it comes to touch typing.

## End note

So to summarize, do I recommend a split keyboard? Absolutely. It's definitely not for everyone, but it's worth at least trying. Colemak? Probably not. It's good, don't get me wrong, but the time investment is huge, and the results may not be significant enough to notice in your daily work compared to sticking with the QWERTY layout.

Personally, I will stay with Colemak, since I'm already invested in that setup and can reap the benefits of it, but I would think twice if I had to do it again.
